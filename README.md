Accordion-menu in React

Goal

The goal is to created tabs where we can expierence with some inforamtion

npm start

I created react app with name tabs and started my project with npm start.

I created new folder called components where I created a new file called App.js. In this folder I also created Header.js where I had header and div for underline, and this file I imported in App.js. 
In App.js I did fetch date using axios and I did map statement to display this job. So, I created a new file called Jobs.js where I used props from the parent component and displayed title, company and dates and I also used map statement to displayed duties.

And I did some stay in index.css.
