npm start

I created react app with name tabs and started my project with npm start.

I created new folder called components where I created a new file called App.js. In this file I created Routes with Routes for every different path, and I created files for every that path. In this file I imported Navbar so before that I created that file. In Navbar.js I created header and links for every pages. In App.js I also imported Header.js, I created that file where I had header and have button to navigate on page contact. 

So I in that file created container and I created three inputs field for name, email and message.

In Home.js I created header and in this file I imported Cards.js. in this file I created Card form material ul and card content, typography and typography body for the text. That I did for all three cards. Here I did state and fetch data using axios and map statement do display jobs. 

For that I created Jobs.js where I displayed all content and here I had button to navigate on the about page. 

And I did some stay in index.css.
